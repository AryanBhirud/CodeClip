# CodeClip

CodeClip is a lightweight tool written in `go-lang` which allows you to copy your codebase to a `codebase_dump.txt` text file and also to your clipboard so that you can feed it to a large language model with ease without actually copying each file.

## Setup Instructions

 - Unzip the cclip_win64.zip file and extract all contents to a location of your choice.
 - Add the path to the location of `cclip.exe` to the `PATH` in your `environment variables`.
 - Run the command `cclip` in the directory with your code.
